Description: The 'Flexible Statistical Data Analysis - FSDA' software
    aims to provide the data science community with principled methods
    for robust statistical analysis. It addresses numerical and categorical
    data with methods ranging from standard data summaries to sophisticated
    regression, multivariate, model selection and transformation tools.
    The distinctive feature of FSDA is that it is targeted to any step
    of the data analysis process that might be faced with data anomalies
    and deviations from model assumptions, and possibly require user
    interactivity with dynamic data visualizations.
    The package 'fsdac' shows how FSDA functions in C code obtained from the
    MATLAB coder can be called from R (using the R functions .C and/or .Call).
    It therefore provides a interface to the 'MATLAB' toolbox FSDA.
    The current R version implements tools for regression:
    (forward search, S- and MM-estimation, least trimmed
    squares (LTS) and least median of squares (LMS)),
    for multivariate analysis (forward search, S- and MM-estimation),
    for cluster analysis (TCLUST) and time series analysis (LTSts).
    The distinctive feature of our package is the possibility of
    monitoring the statistics of interest as function of breakdown point,
    efficiency or subset size, depending on the estimator.
