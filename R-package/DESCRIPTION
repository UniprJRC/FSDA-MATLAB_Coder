Description: The 'Flexible Statistical Data Analysis - FSDA' software aims to provide
    the data science community with principled methods for robust statistical analysis.
    The distinctive feature of FSDA is that, differently from the traditional robust
    packages which given a fixed value of breakdown point (in case of S estimator,
    LMS and LTS) or given a fixed value of efficiency (MM estimators) provide
    a snapshot of the data, it gives particular attention to the monitoring
    approach, that is to understand how the fitted model changes as breakdown
    point/efficiency changes and or the units belonging to subset (as in the
    forward search) increase. The current version implements tools for regression
    (forward search, least trimmed squares (LTS) and least median of squares (LMS)),
    transformation of the response (function FSRfan), multivariate analysis (FSM)
    and time series analysis (LTSts). The distinctive feature of our package is
    the possibility of monitoring the statistics of interest as a function of
    breakdown point, efficiency or subset size, depending on the estimator.
    In the monitoring approach, in order to better understand the effect that
    particular units, outliers or not, exert on the model, it is of paramount
    importance to have interactivity tools which enable to link the information
    present in different logical connected plots. In the companion package 'fsdaR',
    through the installation of the free MATLAB run time environment,
    it is also possible to have a rich set of graphical features, such
    as dynamic brushing, linking, particularly useful for exploratory
    data analysis.
