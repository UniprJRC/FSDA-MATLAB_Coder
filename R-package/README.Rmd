# fsdac

This is a package to demonstrate the development of an R package using native 
C code generated by the MATLAB Coder: FSR, LXS, FSRfan, FSRbsb, ....

## Installation

You can install queue from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("UniprJRC/FSDA-MATLAB_Coder", subdir="R-package")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you if the package is properly installed:

```{r example}
library(fsdac)
data(wool)
XX <- wool
y <- XX[, ncol(XX)]
X <- XX[, 1:(ncol(XX)-1), drop=FALSE]

##  Function FSRfan stores the score test statistic.
##  In this case we use the five most common values of lambda are considered
out <- FSRfan(y, X)
str(out)

```
